# oes-vertex-array-object polyfill

This is from the [Khronos WebGL repo](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/WebGL/blob/master/sdk/demos/google/resources/OESVertexArrayObject.js) just slightly modified
to just work rather than need explicit initialization.

Just include it on your page and assume getting the extension will succeed.

Also available in npm and bower
